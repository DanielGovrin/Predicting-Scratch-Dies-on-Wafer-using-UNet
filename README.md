# Predicting-Scratch-Dies-on-Wafer-using-UNet
This repository contains my implementation of a UNet-based model for predicting whether a given die on a wafer map belongs to a scratch or not. The model is trained using labeled data that includes information about individual dies from multiple wafers.
